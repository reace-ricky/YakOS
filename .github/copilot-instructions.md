# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions for YakOS

**Always read `ROADMAP.md` first** before making any changes to this repository.

`ROADMAP.md` is the project's memory loop — it contains the end goal, the list of completed features, the remaining work items, and the architecture overview. Understanding it before touching code ensures changes stay aligned with the project direction and avoids re-doing or undoing prior work.

After completing work in a session, update `ROADMAP.md`:
- Move newly-completed items from the 🔲 **Remaining** table into the ✅ **Built** table.
- Add any significant new files or features to the architecture diagram.
- Leave a brief note in the relevant row about what was done and which PR/commit delivered it.
